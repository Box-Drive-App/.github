## About Box Drive
Box Drive transforms cloud storage into a seamless desktop experience by integrating Box's enterprise-grade content management platform directly into the native file system of your computer. The application provides users with transparent access to their entire Box cloud storage as if it were a local drive, while intelligently managing which files are stored locally and which remain in the cloud. This approach combines the convenience of local file access with the scalability and collaboration benefits of cloud storage, eliminating the need to manually download and upload files when working with cloud content.

The desktop application delivers enterprise-level cloud storage integration for both macOS and Windows platforms, featuring on-demand file streaming that downloads files only when they're accessed, significantly reducing local storage requirements. Box Drive's offline access capabilities ensure that selected files remain available even without an internet connection, with automatic synchronization when connectivity is restored. With support for file locking to prevent conflicts during collaborative editing, integration with desktop applications like Microsoft Office, and maintenance of Box's comprehensive security and compliance features, Box Drive serves as the bridge between traditional file management workflows and modern cloud collaboration for businesses of all sizes.
